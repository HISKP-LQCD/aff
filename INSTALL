To install the library, you need to create a configuration for your machine.
Consult existing configurations in config.* for inspiration. If none of the
preexisting configuration fits your machine, choose one that is close enough
and tweak it. Please send us back a new configuration file once it is working
and we will include it in the official distribution.

The following is the acutual build procedure we use on the MIT Blue Gene.

1. Unpack the distribution:

% bunzip2 < lhpc-afff-1.0.0.tar.bz | tar -xf -

2. Build the library.

% make CONFIG=config.bgl

3. Install it

% su
# make CONFIG=config.bgl install prefix=/opt/SciDEC/fen64/lhpc-aff-1.0.0
# exit
